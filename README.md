## What it does
LOIE creates a safe and inclusive environment that allows young people to share their true feelings; and with users' input, it provides the tools they need to deal with loneliness. LOIE's main purpose is to encourage users to 1) connect with themselves or 2) connect with others when they feel lonely. Users can share anything with LOIE’s AI chatbot “Evie” whenever and wherever; in turn, Evie serves as a smart virtual friend to provide users with emotional support and guidance using technology like Deep Neural Learning, Natural Language Processing and Emotion AI. Furthermore, LOIE uses Machine Learning based on users' data to connect users with like-minded people through online communities, forming support groups and help each other out.
